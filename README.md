# Dogs

I made this program for fun and because I love dogs. I hope to someday make it into an android app with additional breeds and information about each breed. The purpose of this program was to outline the logic I will use in the related app that I will create later. 

The main challenge I had with this project was deciding how to create something without an assigment. Usually, class assignments give you guidance on what to build. For this project, I just knew I wanted to create something with pictures of cute dogs. From that point, I decided to give users an option to see new dogs (by showing a random dog) or see a picture of a specific breed. 

To run this program:<br> 
Clone all files into the same directory on your machine using command line: <br>
git clone https://github.com/arianna-h-h/Dogs.git. <br>
Compile and run in the command line using commands:<br>
Javac Main.java<br>
Java Main <br>
Enter input via keyboard into the command line when prompted.
