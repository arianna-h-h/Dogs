# Dogs

I made this program for fun and because I love dogs. I hope to someday make it into an android app with additional breeds and information about each breed. The purpose of this program was to outline the logic I will use in the related app that I will create later. 

The main challenge I had with this project was deciding how to create something without an assigment. Usually, class assignments give you guidance on what to build. For this project, I just knew I wanted to create something with pictures of cute dogs. From that point, I decided to give users an option to see new dogs (by showing a random dog) or see a picture of a specific breed. 

To run this program: Download all files into the same directory on your machine. Compile and run in the command line using the commands Javac Main.java and Java Main. Enter input via keyboard into the command line when prompted.
